üè† Welcome to my repository where I've channeled my curiosity about real estate trends into a practical, interactive dashboard using Tableau. 
This dashboard is a deep dive into the Washington state housing market, showcasing its dynamics through various data visualizations.

**Dashboard Features**

- **Interactive Filters:** Users can tailor the data display by selecting dates, property sizes, and construction years.
- **Daily Sales Price Trends:** A line chart that dynamically presents the fluctuations in average house sales prices.
- **Geographic Pricing Overview:** A map view that color-codes average sales prices by ZIP code for a spatial analysis of market trends.
- **Detailed Market Distributions:** Histograms offer insights into the distribution of house prices, as well as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms per property.
- **Condition Versus Value Heatmap:** Understand how the condition of properties correlates with their market values at a glance.

**Built with Tableau**

This dashboard was entirely built with Tableau, the powerful data visualization tool that allows for intricate and interactive data representation. Tableau's robust features enabled me to transform complex datasets into engaging and insightful visual stories.

**Objective of the Project**

This project was born out of my passion for data visualization and a keen interest in the real estate market.

It aims to:

- **Democratize Data:** Making detailed housing market data accessible and interpretable to everyone.
